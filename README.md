# Subtitle Sage

This project is currently in its inception stage and I'm excited to start building it out!

## About

Subtitle Sage will be an iOS/Android video player that allows language learners to interact with subtitles effortlessly through a popup dictionary.

Users will supply their own video & subtitles, and will be able to see translations and word information while watching.

The hope is to support multiple languages, but English speakers learning Japanese will be the initial priority.

## The Problem ##
The current mobile workflow is extremely tedious when trying to immerse in your target language. 

Let's say you're watching content and you find a word that you want to know the meaning of. You now have to switch over to your dictionary app or prepare a google  search. Then you have to use the foreign keyboard and type the desired subtitle. This can take forever! Now you've retrieved the dictionary entry. You try to read the meaning, but at this point you've spent so long getting here that you have forgotten any helpful context. Finally, you have to switch back to your video and refocus yourself. And then rinse & repeat.

Doing all of this isn't very fun, especially when you are just chilling in bed! I hope to consolidate the entire process into one single app that makes things effortless and enjoyable.
